# Scarcity.

Human Beings have needs and these needs are ***unlimited***. we cannot ever be satisfied by our current needs, we will always require more.On the other hand the resources we need are ***scarce*** and cannot be met by everyone equivocally.

This brings in the Two-Prolonged problem:
1. There is a fixed stock of resources at any point in time.
2. There are millions and millions of wants.

NB: 
- **Income** or **wealth** are not relevant here.
- **Scarce** does not mean **poor**. Scarcity occurs with everyone. The **rich** and the **poor**.

# Factors Of Production.
Resources can be defined as **the inputs used in the production of those things that we desire**
When resources are productive they are typically called the *factors of production*.
Factors can be classified in many ways.
One common scheme of classification includes :-
- Natural resources.
- Human resources.
- Manufactured resources.
### Natural Resources
These include Land, Capital, Water, Climate, Vegetation Etc.
