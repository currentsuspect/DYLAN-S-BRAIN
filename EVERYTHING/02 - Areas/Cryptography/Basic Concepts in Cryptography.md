**Chapter 2: Basic Concepts in Cryptography**

**2.1 Encryption**

Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (human-readable data) into ciphertext (unreadable data) using an algorithm and a key. The resulting ciphertext appears as a random sequence of characters and is unintelligible without the corresponding decryption key. Encryption ensures the confidentiality of data by preventing unauthorized parties from understanding its contents.

**2.2 Decryption**

Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. It involves converting ciphertext back into plaintext using the appropriate decryption algorithm and key. Only individuals with the correct decryption key can decipher the encrypted data and recover the original plaintext.

**2.3 Cipher**

A cipher is a cryptographic algorithm used for encryption and decryption. It defines the rules and procedures for transforming plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa. Ciphers can be classified into two main categories: symmetric and asymmetric.

**2.4 Key**

A key is a piece of information used by a cryptographic algorithm to control the encryption and decryption processes. In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, whereas in asymmetric encryption, a pair of keys (public and private) are used. The security of cryptographic systems often relies on the secrecy and strength of the keys.

**2.5 Cryptosystem**

A cryptosystem is a combination of cryptographic algorithms, keys, and protocols used to secure communication and data. It encompasses all the components necessary for encryption, decryption, key management, and secure communication. A well-designed cryptosystem ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information exchanged between parties.
