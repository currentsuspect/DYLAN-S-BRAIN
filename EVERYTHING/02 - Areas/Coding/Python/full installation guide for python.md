**Step 1: Download Python Installer**

1. Open your web browser and go to the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. On the homepage, you'll see a button labeled "Downloads." Click on it.

3. You'll be directed to the downloads page. Python offers two major versions: Python 3.x and Python 2.x. It's recommended to download Python 3.x as Python 2.x is no longer supported. 

4. Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system. For Windows, you'll typically download an executable installer (.exe), while for macOS and Linux, you might download a package installer or source code. 

**Step 2: Run the Python Installer**

**For Windows:**

1. Once the installer is downloaded, double-click on the executable file to run it.

2. You'll see a checkbox labeled "Add Python X.X to PATH." Make sure this option is checked. This will add Python to your system's PATH variable, allowing you to run Python from any command prompt or terminal window.

3. Click on the "Install Now" button to begin the installation process.

4. The installer will copy the necessary files and set up Python on your system. This might take a few moments.

**For macOS:**

1. Open the downloaded package installer (.pkg) file by double-clicking on it.

2. Follow the prompts in the installer. You may need to enter your administrator password to allow the installation to proceed.

3. Once the installation is complete, close the installer.

**For Linux:**

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Python source code or package installer.

3. Run the following command to extract the contents of the package (replace `filename` with the actual name of the file you downloaded):

   ```
   tar -xzf filename
   ```

4. Navigate into the extracted directory.

5. Run the following commands to configure and install Python:

   ```
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

**Step 3: Verify Your Installation**

Once Python is installed, you can verify it by opening a command prompt or terminal window and typing the following command:

```
python --version
```

You should see the version number of Python printed to the screen, indicating that Python has been successfully installed on your system.

That's it! You've now installed Python on your computer and are ready to start coding. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, feel free to ask for assistance.
