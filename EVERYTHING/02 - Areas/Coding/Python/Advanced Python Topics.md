Sure, let's dive into Chapter 4 of the Python course, covering Advanced Python Topics:

**Chapter 4: Advanced Python Topics**

**Section 1: Regular Expressions**

Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They provide a powerful way to search, extract, and manipulate text data. Python's `re` module provides support for working with regular expressions. Here's how you can use regular expressions in Python:

```python
# Example of using regular expressions
import re

# Matching a pattern in a string
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
pattern = r"fox"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
    print("Pattern found:", match.group())
```

```python
# Extracting numbers from a string
text = "I have 2 apples and 3 bananas"
pattern = r"\d+"
numbers = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(numbers)  # Output: ['2', '3']
```

**Section 2: Decorators**

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without modifying their underlying code. Decorators are typically used to add functionality such as logging, authentication, caching, etc. Here's how you can define and use decorators in Python:

```python
# Example of a decorator
def uppercase_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return result.upper()
    return wrapper

@uppercase_decorator
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: HELLO, ALICE!
```

**Section 3: Generators and Iterators**

Generators and iterators are used to generate sequences of values lazily, one at a time. They are memory-efficient and allow you to work with large datasets without loading everything into memory at once. Here's how you can use generators and iterators in Python:

```python
# Example of a generator
def count_up_to(max):
    count = 1
    while count <= max:
        yield count
        count += 1

counter = count_up_to(5)
for num in counter:
    print(num)  # Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

**Section 4: Multithreading and Multiprocessing**

Multithreading and multiprocessing are techniques used to achieve concurrency in Python, allowing you to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Multithreading is suitable for I/O-bound tasks, while multiprocessing is suitable for CPU-bound tasks. Here's how you can work with multithreading and multiprocessing in Python:

```python
# Example of multithreading
import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)

thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

```python
# Example of multiprocessing
import multiprocessing

def square(x):
    return x**2

pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4)
results = pool.map(square, range(10))
print(results)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

**Section 5: Working with Databases**

Python provides support for working with various database systems, including SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc. You can use libraries such as `sqlite3`, `MySQLdb`, `psycopg2`, `pymongo`, etc., to interact with databases from Python. Here's an example of working with SQLite in Python:

```python
# Example of working with SQLite
import sqlite3

# Connecting to a SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect("example.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Creating a table
cursor.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT,
        age INTEGER
    )
""")

# Inserting data into the table
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)", ("Alice", 30))
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)", ("Bob", 25))

# Committing changes and closing the connection
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

**Section 6: Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup and Requests**

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. Python provides libraries such as `requests` and `Beautiful Soup` that make it easy to scrape web pages and extract information. Here's how you can use these libraries to scrape data from a web page:

```python
# Example of web scraping with Beautiful Soup and Requests
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://example.com"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")

# Extracting information from the web page
title = soup.title.text
paragraphs = soup.find_all("p")
for p in paragraphs:
    print(p.text)
```

**Section 7: Introduction to Web Development with Flask**

Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that makes it easy to build web applications. It provides features such as routing, templates, request handling, etc. Here's a simple example of a Flask web application:

```python
# Example of a Flask web application
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
