#### What is Version Control?
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, enabling you to recall specific versions later. It's commonly used in software development to track code changes, but it's also valuable for managing any type of file.

#### Benefits of Version Control
1. **History Tracking**: Easily view and revert to previous versions of files.
2. **Collaboration**: Enable multiple people to work on the same files simultaneously.
3. **Branching and Merging**: Experiment with new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Resolve conflicts that arise when multiple people modify the same file.
5. **Backup and Recovery**: Protect against data loss by storing files in a central repository.

#### Types of Version Control Systems
1. **Local Version Control Systems**: Keep track of changes on a single computer. Examples include RCS (Revision Control System) and SCCS (Source Code Control System).
2. **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)**: Store files on a central server, allowing multiple users to access and modify them. Examples include CVS (Concurrent Versions System) and Subversion (SVN).
3. **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)**: Every user has a complete copy of the repository, enabling them to work offline and commit changes locally before synchronizing with a central server. Git and Mercurial are examples of DVCS.
