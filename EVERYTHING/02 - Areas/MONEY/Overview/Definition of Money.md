**1. Introduction to Money**

**[[Definition of Money]]**: Money is more than just paper or coins; it's a fascinating concept that symbolizes value in society. At its core, money serves as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. It enables people to trade goods and services efficiently, facilitating economic transactions.

**[[Historical Evolution of Money]]**: The story of money stretches back thousands of years, evolving from barter systems to various forms of currency. From shells and beads to precious metals like gold and silver, humans have used different objects as money throughout history. Today, we mainly rely on fiat currency, which is backed by the government's authority rather than intrinsic value.

**Types of Money**: Money comes in various forms, each with its unique characteristics. Fiat money, such as dollars or euros, derives its value from government regulation. Commodity money, like gold or silver coins, holds inherent value based on the material it's made of. Additionally, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have emerged as decentralized digital currencies, challenging traditional notions of money.
