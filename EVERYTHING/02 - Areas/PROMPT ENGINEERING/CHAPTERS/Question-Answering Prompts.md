**b. Question-Answering Prompts:**

**Interrogative Prompts:** Prompting the model with questions guides it to generate responses that address the queries posed. For example, a prompt like "What are the main causes of climate change?" prompts the model to generate an answer that provides information on the specified topic.

**Contextual Embeddings:** Including contextual information within the prompt helps frame the question and guide the model's understanding. This contextual information provides background knowledge or situational cues that aid the model in generating accurate and relevant responses.

**Evaluation Metrics:** Designing prompts with built-in evaluation mechanisms enables the assessment of the quality and relevance of the generated answers. By incorporating evaluation metrics directly into the prompt, users can provide feedback to the model and guide its learning process.
