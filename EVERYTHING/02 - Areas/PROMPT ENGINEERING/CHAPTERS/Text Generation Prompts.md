**a. Text Generation Prompts:**

**Seed Text:** When using seed text, a portion of text is provided as an initial input to the model, guiding it to generate text that continues from or is influenced by the provided content. For example, if the seed text is "Once upon a time," the model might generate a story that follows the narrative style established by this initial phrase.

**Prompt Pivoting:** This technique involves iteratively refining prompts based on previous model outputs. After generating text with an initial prompt, the output is examined, and subsequent prompts are adjusted to steer the model towards more desirable responses. This iterative process continues until satisfactory results are achieved.

**Control Tokens:** Control tokens are special tokens embedded within the prompt to control specific aspects of the generated text, such as sentiment, style, or topic. By incorporating control tokens, users can exert fine-grained control over the model's output, influencing its behavior to better align with their objectives.
