**c. Text Classification Prompts:**

**Label Indicators:** Including label indicators within the prompt helps guide the model towards classifying text into predefined categories or labels. For example, a prompt like "Classify the following news article as either politics, sports, or entertainment" provides clear instructions for the classification task.

**Feature Engineering:** Crafting prompts to highlight relevant features or characteristics of the text aids in classification tasks. By emphasizing specific attributes or aspects of the text within the prompt, users can guide the model's attention towards important information for classification.

**Multi-Label Classification:** Designing prompts to handle scenarios where text may belong to multiple categories simultaneously requires a nuanced approach. Prompt engineering techniques for multi-label classification involve providing appropriate cues and instructions to enable the model to assign multiple relevant labels to the text.
