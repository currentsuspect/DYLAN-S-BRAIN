## INTRODUCTION 

Prompt engineering refers to the deliberate crafting and optimization of prompts used to interact with language models, particularly large pre-trained models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). These prompts serve as instructions or cues to guide the model's generation of text in a desired manner. The field of prompt engineering has gained significant attention as researchers and practitioners seek to harness the capabilities of language models for various applications while controlling and shaping their outputs.

Language models like GPT excel at generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on the input they receive. However, without careful prompt engineering, their outputs may not align with the user's intentions or the task at hand. By designing effective prompts, users can steer the model's responses towards desired outcomes, such as generating specific types of content, providing accurate answers to questions, or exhibiting particular conversational behaviors.

Prompt engineering involves a combination of[[LINGUISTICS| Linguistic knowledge]], experimental design, and computational techniques. It requires an understanding of the language model's capabilities and limitations, as well as the nuances of human language and communication. Effective prompt design considers factors such as vocabulary choice, syntactic structure, context establishment, and task specificity.
