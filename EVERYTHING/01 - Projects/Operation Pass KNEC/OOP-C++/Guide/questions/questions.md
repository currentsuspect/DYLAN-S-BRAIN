#### Section C: Short Answer Questions (30 marks)

**1. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP with an example. (5 marks)**

**Answer:**
- **Inheritance:** The mechanism by which one class (derived/subclass) inherits the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (base/superclass). This allows for code reusability and hierarchical classification.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  // Base class
  class Animal {
      void eat() {
          System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
      }
  }

  // Derived class
  class Dog extends Animal {
      void bark() {
          System.out.println("The dog barks.");
      }
  }

  // Main class
  public class TestInheritance {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Dog d = new Dog();
          d.eat(); // Inherited method
          d.bark(); // Specific to Dog
      }
  }
  ```

**2. What is polymorphism in OOP? Provide an example to illustrate your answer. (5 marks)**

**Answer:**
- **Polymorphism:** The ability of a single function or method to operate in different ways based on the object that it is acting upon. It is achieved through method overloading and method overriding.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  // Base class
  class Animal {
      void makeSound() {
          System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
      }
  }

  // Derived class
  class Dog extends Animal {
      void makeSound() {
          System.out.println("Dog barks");
      }
  }

  // Derived class
  class Cat extends Animal {
      void makeSound() {
          System.out.println("Cat meows");
      }
  }

  // Main class
  public class TestPolymorphism {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Animal a;
          a = new Dog();
          a.makeSound(); // Output: Dog barks

          a = new Cat();
          a.makeSound(); // Output: Cat meows
      }
  }
  ```

**3. Describe the concept of encapsulation and its benefits. (5 marks)**

**Answer:**
- **Encapsulation:** The bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object’s components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse of the methods and data.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Improved Data Security:** Sensitive data can be hidden from the user.
  - **Modularity:** The internal details of an object’s operation are hidden, promoting a modular approach to programming.
  - **Maintenance:** Changes in the implementation of a class do not affect other parts of a program.
  - **Reusability:** Well-defined interfaces allow objects to be reused in different contexts.

**4. What are interfaces in Java? How do they differ from abstract classes? Provide an example. (5 marks)**

**Answer:**
- **Interfaces:** A reference type in Java, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Methods in interfaces are abstract by default.
- **Differences from Abstract Classes:**
  - **Abstract Classes:** Can have instance variables, constructors, and fully implemented methods. Can extend only one class.
  - **Interfaces:** Cannot have instance variables or constructors. Methods are abstract by default and can be implemented by multiple classes (through multiple inheritance).

- **Example:**
  ```java
  // Interface
  interface Animal {
      void eat();
  }

  // Implementing the interface
  class Dog implements Animal {
      public void eat() {
          System.out.println("Dog eats meat");
      }
  }

  public class TestInterface {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Dog d = new Dog();
          d.eat(); // Output: Dog eats meat
      }
  }
  ```

**5. Explain method overloading with an example. (5 marks)**

**Answer:**
- **Method Overloading:** The ability to define multiple methods with the same name but with different parameter lists (different number of parameters, types of parameters, or both) within the same class.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  class MathOperations {
     



 // Method with 2 int parameters
      int add(int a, int b) {
          return a + b;
      }

      // Method with 3 int parameters
      int add(int a, int b, int c) {
          return a + b + c;
      }

      // Method with 2 double parameters
      double add(double a, double b) {
          return a + b;
      }
  }

  public class TestOverloading {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          MathOperations mo = new MathOperations();
          System.out.println(mo.add(5, 3));        // Output: 8
          System.out.println(mo.add(5, 3, 2));     // Output: 10
          System.out.println(mo.add(5.5, 3.5));    // Output: 9.0
      }
  }
  ```

#### Section D: Essay Questions (40 marks)

**1. Discuss the principles of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and how they contribute to software development. Include real-world examples for each principle. (20 marks)**

**Answer:**
- **Encapsulation:**
  - **Principle:** Bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within one unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components.
  - **Example:** In a banking application, an `Account` class may encapsulate account details and operations like deposit and withdrawal, protecting the internal state of the account.
  - **Contribution:** Increases modularity and maintainability by hiding the internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.

- **Abstraction:**
  - **Principle:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
  - **Example:** A `Car` class might provide methods like `drive` and `brake` without exposing the complexities of the engine mechanics.
  - **Contribution:** Simplifies complex systems by providing a simplified model, thus enhancing readability and reducing complexity.

- **Inheritance:**
  - **Principle:** Creating a new class that is based on an existing class by extending its properties and behaviors.
  - **Example:** A `Bird` class can inherit from an `Animal` class and add specific features like `fly`.
  - **Contribution:** Promotes code reuse and hierarchical organization, allowing new functionalities to be built upon existing ones without redundancy.

- **Polymorphism:**
  - **Principle:** The ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms (data types).
  - **Example:** A `Payment` interface might be implemented by different classes like `CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`, etc., each providing its own method of processing payment.
  - **Contribution:** Enhances flexibility and integration, allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class, which simplifies code and improves extensibility.

**2. Explain the process of designing an object-oriented system from requirements gathering to implementation. Include the stages and activities involved. (20 marks)**

**Answer:**
- **Requirements Gathering:**
  - **Activities:** Collecting requirements through interviews, surveys, and document analysis to understand the needs and constraints.
  - **Output:** Requirements specification document.

- **Analysis and Conceptual Design:**
  - **Activities:** Identifying key objects, classes, and relationships using tools like UML diagrams.
  - **Output:** Use case diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams.

- **System Design:**
  - **Activities:** Defining the system architecture, interfaces, and data flow. Determining class responsibilities and interactions.
  - **Output:** Detailed design documents including class hierarchies and interaction diagrams.

- **Implementation:**
  - **Activities:** Writing the code for the classes, methods, and interactions defined in the design phase. Implementing algorithms and data structures.
  - **Output:** Functional codebase.

- **Testing:**
  - **Activities:** Verifying that the system meets the requirements through unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
  - **Output:** Test reports and validation against requirements.

- **Deployment:**
  - **Activities:** Deploying the system in the production environment, conducting user training, and providing documentation.
  - **Output:** Deployed system and user manuals.

- **Maintenance:**
  - **Activities:** Monitoring performance, fixing bugs, updating the system, and improving functionalities based on user feedback.
  - **Output:** Maintained and updated system.
