# Introduction to OOP
- **What is OOP?**
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. It emphasizes the organization of software as a collection of objects that encapsulate data and behavior.

- **Advantages of OOP**
  - **[[Encapsulation]]:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components.
  - **[[Inheritance]]:** Allowing a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class, promoting code reuse and hierarchical organization.
  - **[[Polymorphism]]:** The ability for different objects to respond to the same message (method call) in different ways, enabling flexibility and extensibility in code design.
