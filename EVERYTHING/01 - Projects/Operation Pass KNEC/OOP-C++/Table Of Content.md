###  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

#### Part 1: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and Basics of C++
1. **[[Introduction to OOP]]**
   - What is OOP?
   - Advantages of OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism).
   
2. **[[Basics of C++]]**
   - Overview of C++ syntax and structure.
   - Data types, variables, and operators.
   - Control structures (if, else, loops).

#### Part 2: Classes and Objects
3. **Classes and Objects**
   - Defining a class in C++.
   - Class members: attributes and methods.
   - Creating objects from classes.
   - Accessing members using dot (.) and arrow (->) operators.

4. **Constructors and Destructors**
   - Constructors: default, parameterized, copy constructors.
   - Destructors: purpose and usage.
   - Constructor initialization lists.

#### Part 3: Encapsulation and Access Control
5. **Encapsulation**
   - Encapsulation in C++.
   - Access specifiers: public, private, protected.
   - Using getter and setter methods.

#### Part 4: Inheritance
6. **Inheritance**
   - Base and derived classes.
   - Types of inheritance: single, multiple, multilevel.
   - Access control in inheritance.

7. **Polymorphism**
   - Function overloading.
   - Operator overloading.
   - Virtual functions and runtime polymorphism (dynamic binding).

#### Part 5: Advanced Concepts
8. **Advanced Inheritance Topics**
   - Virtual base classes.
   - Abstract classes and pure virtual functions.
   - Interface classes in C++.

9. **Templates**
   - Function templates.
   - Class templates.
   - Template specialization.

10. **STL (Standard Template Library)**
    - Overview of containers (vector, list, map, etc.).
    - Algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.).
    - Iterators.

#### Part 6: Exception Handling and File I/O
11. **Exception Handling**
    - Basics of exception handling in C++.
    - try, catch, throw statements.

12. **File I/O**
    - File handling in C++.
    - Reading from and writing to files.

#### Part 7: Best Practices and Design Patterns
13. **Best Practices in OOP**
    - Design principles (SOLID principles).
    - Code reusability and maintainability.

14. **Design Patterns**
    - Introduction to common design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.).

#### Part 8: Advanced Topics and Beyond
15. **Concurrency and Multithreading**
    - Basics of multithreading in C++.
    - Synchronization and thread safety.

16. **Lambda Expressions**
    - Introduction to lambda expressions.

#### Part 9: C++11, C++14, and C++17 Features
17. **Modern C++ Features**
    - Overview of new features in C++11, C++14, and C++17.

### Conclusion
18. **Review and Practical Applications**
    - Recap of key concepts.
    - Practical applications of OOP in C++.

### Additional Resources
- Recommended books, websites, and tutorials for further learning.
