   - **Marks Distribution:** Know the weight of each section/question.

**2. Pre-Exam Preparation:**
   - **Create a Study Schedule:** Allocate specific times for each topic leading up to the exam.
   - **Practice Past Papers:** Familiarize yourself with the types of questions asked.
   - **Summarize Key Concepts:** Create summary notes for quick revision.

### Detailed Exam Plan
---
**1. Allocate Time per Section:**
   - **Reading Time (15 minutes):** Skim through the entire paper. Note the questions, mark the ones you find easiest, and plan your approach.
   - **Short Answer Questions (30 minutes):** Quickly answer the questions you are most confident about. These usually carry fewer marks but are faster to complete.
   - **Long Essays (90 minutes):** Allocate about 30 minutes per essay question. Spend the first 5 minutes outlining your answer, 20 minutes writing, and 5 minutes reviewing.
   - **Case Studies/Applied Questions (45 minutes):** Spend around 15 minutes per case study. These require critical thinking and application of knowledge.
   - **Review Time (15 minutes):** Use this time to go through your answers, check for errors, and ensure all questions are answered.

**2. Prioritize Questions:**
   - **High Confidence, High Marks:** Start with questions you are confident about that carry the most marks.
   - **Moderate Confidence, High Marks:** Tackle these next, as they still contribute significantly to your score.
   - **High Confidence, Low Marks:** Quickly answer these to secure easy marks.
   - **Low Confidence, High Marks:** Attempt these after you have secured marks from easier questions.

**3. Tips for Quick Review and Error Checking:**
   - **Clarity and Structure:** Ensure your answers are clear and well-structured. Use headings and bullet points where appropriate.
   - **Check for Completeness:** Ensure you have answered all parts of each question.
   - **Grammar and Spelling:** Quickly scan for any obvious grammatical or spelling errors.
   - **Technical Accuracy:** Verify that your technical explanations and terminology are correct.
