### Example Schema for a KNEC Exam Question

**Question:** Explain the causes of scope creep in system analysis and design.

---

**Answer:**

### Introduction
Scope creep refers to the uncontrolled expansion of a project’s scope after the project has commenced. This often leads to delays, budget overruns, and project failure. In system analysis and design, scope creep can arise from various causes.

### Main Body
#### 1. Poorly Defined Project Scope
- **Initial Ambiguity:** A project with a vague or undefined scope leads to different interpretations by stakeholders, resulting in additional requests.
- **Inadequate Requirements Gathering:** Failing to gather and document user requirements thoroughly can result in missing critical functionalities, which leads to additional changes.

#### 2. Stakeholder Influence
- **Changing Requirements:** As the project progresses, stakeholders may change their requirements, adding new features and functionalities.
- **New Stakeholders:** Introducing new stakeholders during the project can result in new demands and requirements not considered initially.

#### 3. Lack of Change Control Processes
- **Uncontrolled Changes:** Without a formal change control process, any request can be accepted without proper evaluation, leading to scope creep.
- **Lack of Documentation:** Failure to document changes properly causes misunderstandings about the current scope.

#### 4. Underestimation of Complexity
- **Underestimating Tasks:** Misjudging the complexity of tasks or the time required can lead to additional work to meet the original goals.
- **Technical Challenges:** Unforeseen technical difficulties can necessitate changes to the project plan and scope.

#### 5. Communication Breakdowns
- **Inadequate Communication:** Poor communication among team members, stakeholders, and clients can result in misunderstandings about project requirements and expectations.
- **Misaligned Expectations:** If all parties do not have a shared understanding of the project goals and deliverables, scope creep is more likely to occur.

#### 6. External Factors
- **Market Changes:** Shifts in the market or technology landscape can lead to new requirements being added to keep the project relevant.
- **Regulatory Changes:** New laws or regulations can necessitate changes to the project scope to ensure compliance.

#### 7. Project Management Issues
- **Inexperienced Project Managers:** Lack of experience in managing projects can lead to insufficient planning and scope management.
- **Inadequate Risk Management:** Failing to identify and plan for potential risks can lead to unexpected changes in scope.

#### 8. Inconsistent Prioritization
- **Changing Priorities:** Frequent changes in project priorities can lead to new features being added or existing ones being modified.
- **Feature Creep:** Adding new features that are not essential to the project’s core objectives can divert resources and extend timelines.

### Conclusion
Managing scope creep effectively requires clear objectives, formal change control processes, regular communication, comprehensive documentation, and continuous monitoring of project progress. By addressing these causes, project managers can better control scope creep and ensure project success.
