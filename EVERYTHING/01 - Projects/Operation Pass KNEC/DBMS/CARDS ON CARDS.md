**Question:** What are the four characteristics of a primary key in Database Management Systems (DBMS)
?
**Answer:**
1. **Uniqueness:** Ensures each value in the primary key column(s) is unique within the table.
2. **Non-null:** Requires that the primary key values cannot be NULL, ensuring each record has a valid identifier.
3. **Unchangeability:** Once assigned, primary key values generally should not change to maintain consistency.
4. **Minimality:** Ideally composed of the smallest set of columns needed to ensure uniqueness, optimizing performance. <!--SR:!2024-07-11,3,250-->



**Question:** What is the difference between an associated record and an orphan record in a database
?
**Answer:**
- **Associated Record:** An associated record refers to a record that has valid relationships with records in other tables. It has corresponding related records in related tables, linked through foreign key relationships.
- **Orphan Record:** An orphan record is a record that exists in a table but lacks corresponding related records in related tables. This can occur when a related record is deleted without appropriately handling referential integrity, leaving the orphan record disconnected or "orphaned." <!--SR:!2024-07-09,1,230-->

Certainly! Here are some questions on normalization up to Third Normal Form (3NF):

---

**Q: What is normalization in the context of database design?** 
?
**A:** Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency by splitting large tables into smaller tables and defining relationships between them.

**Q: Explain the concept of functional dependency in database normalization.**  
?
**A:** Functional dependency in normalization states that the value of one attribute (or set of attributes) determines the value of another attribute(s) in a database table.

**Q: What is the purpose of First Normal Form (1NF) in database normalization?**  
?
**A:** 1NF ensures that each column in a table contains atomic (indivisible) values and that each column has a unique name.

**Q: Describe the requirements for a table to be in Second Normal Form (2NF).**  
?
**A:** For a table to be in 2NF, it must first satisfy 1NF and ensure that all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key. This means eliminating partial dependencies.

**Q: How does Third Normal Form (3NF) differ from Second Normal Form (2NF)?**  
**A:** 3NF requires a table to be in 2NF and ensures that all attributes are functionally dependent only on the primary key, eliminating transitive dependencies.

**Q: Explain the concept of transitive dependency in the context of database normalization.**  
?
**A:** Transitive dependency occurs when a non-key attribute is functionally dependent on another non-key attribute rather than the primary key of the table.

**Q: What are the steps involved in achieving First Normal Form (1NF)?**  
?
**A:** To achieve 1NF, ensure that each column contains atomic values (no repeating groups or arrays), each column has a unique name, and entries in the column are of the same data type.

**Q: Provide an example of a table that violates First Normal Form (1NF) and explain why.**  
?
**A:** Example: A table with a column containing multiple values separated by commas (e.g., "John, Jane, Alice") violates 1NF because it does not have atomic values in each cell.

**Q: How can partial dependencies be eliminated in achieving Second Normal Form (2NF)?**  
**A:** Partial dependencies are eliminated by moving attributes that depend on only part of the primary key to a separate table, linked by a foreign key.

**Q: Why is it important to eliminate anomalies in database tables through normalization?**
?
**A:** Anomalies (insertion, update, and deletion) can lead to inconsistencies and data integrity issues. Normalization reduces anomalies by structuring data tables properly. <!--SR:!2024-07-13,2,230-->

**Q: Describe the benefits of achieving Third Normal Form (3NF) in database design.**

**Q: Explain how denormalization can impact database performance. Provide an example where denormalization might be justified.**
?
**A:** Denormalization can improve database performance by reducing the number of joins required to retrieve data, thus speeding up query execution. However, it can also lead to increased storage requirements and potential data anomalies if not carefully managed. For example, in a reporting database where read performance is critical and updates are infrequent, denormalizing tables by combining frequently joined tables can improve query response times.

**Q: Given a table that violates First Normal Form (1NF), provide an example and explain how you would normalize it.**
?
**A:** Example: A table with repeating groups:
   ```
   OrderID   |   CustomerName   |   Item1   |   Item2   |   Item3
   --------------------------------------------------------------
   1         |   John Doe       |   Apple   |   Orange  |   Banana
   ```
   Normalize to 1NF:
   ```
   OrderID   |   CustomerName   |   Item
   ---------------------------------------
   1         |   John Doe       |   Apple
   1         |   John Doe       |   Orange
   1         |   John Doe       |   Banana
   ```

**Q: Describe a scenario where maintaining data integrity through normalization could prevent data anomalies.**
?
**A:** In a sales database, normalization ensures that customer information is stored in a separate table linked to orders via foreign keys. This prevents anomalies such as deleting a customer inadvertently deleting all associated orders or updating a customer's address inconsistently across multiple orders.

**Q: Discuss the trade-offs between normalization and performance in database design.**
?
**A:** Normalization reduces redundancy and dependency, improving data integrity and consistency but potentially increasing the number of joins needed for queries, which can impact performance. Denormalization, on the other hand, improves query performance by reducing joins but can lead to increased storage requirements and potential data anomalies if not carefully managed.
