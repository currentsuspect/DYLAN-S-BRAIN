#### Section C: Short Answer Questions (30 marks)


**1. Explain the difference between a primary key and a unique key. (5 marks)**
?
**Answer:**
- **Primary Key:**
  - Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
  - Cannot be NULL.
  - Only one primary key is allowed per table.
  - Ensures entity integrity.
- **Unique Key:**
  - Ensures that all values in a column are unique.
  - Can contain NULL values (though each NULL is considered unique).
  - Multiple unique keys can be defined in a table.
  - Used to enforce unique constraints on a column.

**2. What are the different types of JOIN operations in SQL? Explain each with an example. (10 marks)**
?
**Answer:**
- **INNER JOIN:**
  - Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT employees.name, departments.name
    FROM employees
    INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
    ```
- **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):**
  - Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. If no match, NULLs are returned.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT employees.name, departments.name
    FROM employees
    LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
    ```
- **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):**
  - Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table. If no match, NULLs are returned.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT employees.name, departments.name
    FROM employees
    RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
    ```
- **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):**
  - Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table. If no match, NULLs are returned.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT employees.name, departments.name
    FROM employees
    FULL JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
    ```
- **CROSS JOIN:**
  - Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, i.e., all combinations of rows.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT employees.name, departments.name
    FROM employees
    CROSS JOIN departments;
    ```

**3. Describe the concept of normalization and its benefits. (5 marks)**
?
**Answer:**
- **Normalization:** The process of organizing the fields and tables of a database to minimize redundancy and dependency. It involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduces data redundancy.
  - Improves data integrity.
  - Enhances query performance.
  - Simplifies database maintenance.
  - Ensures consistent data through the elimination of anomalies.

**4. What are triggers in a database, and how are they used? Provide an example. (5 marks)**
?
**Answer:**
- **Triggers:** Special procedures that are automatically executed in response to certain events on a particular table or view in a database.
- **Usage:**
  - Enforcing business rules.
  - Validating data integrity.
  - Keeping audit trails.
  - Automating system tasks.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TRIGGER trg_after_insert
  AFTER INSERT ON employees
  FOR EACH ROW
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO employee_audit (employee_id, action, action_time)
    VALUES (NEW.id, 'INSERT', NOW());
  END;
  ```
