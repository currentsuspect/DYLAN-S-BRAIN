Relational algebra is a procedural query language that works on relational databases. In relational algebra, input is a relation, and the output is also a relation. It uses operators to perform queries on the database. Here's a detailed explanation of the primary relational algebra operations:

### Basic Operations

1. **Selection (σ)**:
   - **Purpose**: Selects rows from a relation that satisfy a given predicate.
   - **Notation**: σ<sub>condition</sub>(relation)
   - **Example**: σ<sub>age > 25</sub>(Employee) selects all employees older than 25.

2. **Projection (π)**:
   - **Purpose**: Selects specific columns from a relation.
   - **Notation**: π<sub>column1, column2, ...</sub>(relation)
   - **Example**: π<sub>name, age</sub>(Employee) selects the name and age columns from the Employee relation.

3. **Union (∪)**:
   - **Purpose**: Combines tuples from two relations, removing duplicates.
   - **Notation**: relation1 ∪ relation2
   - **Example**: Employee ∪ Manager combines tuples from both Employee and Manager relations.

4. **Set Difference (−)**:
   - **Purpose**: Returns tuples from one relation that are not in another.
   - **Notation**: relation1 − relation2
   - **Example**: Employee − Manager returns employees who are not managers.

5. **Cartesian Product (×)**:
   - **Purpose**: Combines tuples from two relations in a pairwise fashion.
   - **Notation**: relation1 × relation2
   - **Example**: Employee × Department pairs each employee with every department.

6. **Rename (ρ)**:
   - **Purpose**: Renames the output relation.
   - **Notation**: ρ<sub>new_name</sub>(relation)
   - **Example**: ρ<sub>Emp</sub>(Employee) renames the Employee relation to Emp.

### Derived Operations

1. **Natural Join (⋈)**:
   - **Purpose**: Combines relations based on common attribute values.
   - **Notation**: relation1 ⋈ relation2
   - **Example**: Employee ⋈ Department matches employees to their corresponding departments based on common attributes (like department_id).

2. **Theta Join (⋈<sub>θ</sub>)**:
   - **Purpose**: Combines relations based on a given condition.
   - **Notation**: relation1 ⋈<sub>θ</sub> relation2
   - **Example**: Employee ⋈<sub>Employee.department_id = Department.id</sub> Department joins employees with their respective departments where the department_id matches.

3. **Division (÷)**:
   - **Purpose**: Used when we have a relation A divided by relation B, and we want all tuples from A that match with every tuple in B.
   - **Notation**: relation1 ÷ relation2
   - **Example**: If A is a relation of student-course pairs and B is a relation of all courses, A ÷ B gives students who are enrolled in all courses in B.

### Examples and Use Cases

Consider two relations:
- **Employee (EmpID, EmpName, DeptID, Salary)**
- **Department (DeptID, DeptName)**

#### Example Queries:

1. **Find all employees who work in the "Sales" department**:
   ```plaintext
   SalesDept ← σ<sub>DeptName = 'Sales'</sub>(Department)
   Result ← Employee ⋈<sub>Employee.DeptID = SalesDept.DeptID</sub> SalesDept
   ```

2. **List the names and salaries of employees**:
   ```plaintext
   Result ← π<sub>EmpName, Salary</sub>(Employee)
   ```

3. **Find employees who are not in the "HR" department**:
   ```plaintext
   HRDept ← σ<sub>DeptName = 'HR'</sub>(Department)
   HRDeptIDs ← π<sub>DeptID</sub>(HRDept)
   Result ← Employee − (Employee ⋈<sub>Employee.DeptID = HRDeptIDs.DeptID</sub> HRDeptIDs)
   ```

4. **Get a list of all department names where there is at least one employee**:
   ```plaintext
   DeptWithEmp ← π<sub>DeptID</sub>(Employee)
   Result ← π<sub>DeptName</sub>(DeptWithEmp ⋈<sub>DeptWithEmp.DeptID = Department.DeptID</sub> Department)
   ```

5. **Retrieve the names of employees who earn more than 50,000**:
   ```plaintext
   Result ← σ<sub>Salary > 50000</sub>(Employee)
   ```
