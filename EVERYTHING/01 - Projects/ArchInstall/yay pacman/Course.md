Sure thing, Dylan! Let's dive deep into `yay` and `pacman`, the package managers used in Arch Linux and its derivatives. We'll cover everything from installation and basic commands to advanced usage, so you can manage your system's software like a pro.

## Pacman: The Package Manager for Arch Linux

`pacman` is the default package manager for Arch Linux. It is designed to be simple and efficient, allowing users to install, update, and remove software packages.

### Installing Pacman

`pacman` is pre-installed on Arch Linux. If for some reason you need to reinstall it, you can use:

```sh
sudo pacman -S pacman
```

### Basic Pacman Commands

#### 1. Synchronizing the Package Database

Before installing or updating packages, it's a good idea to synchronize your package database:

```sh
sudo pacman -Sy
```

- `-S`: Synchronize the package database.
- `-y`: Refresh the package database.

#### 2. Installing Packages

To install a package:

```sh
sudo pacman -S package_name
```

- `-S`: Synchronize packages (install them).
- `package_name`: The name of the package you want to install.

#### 3. Updating Packages

To update all installed packages to the latest versions:

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu
```

- `-u`: Upgrade all packages that are out of date.
- Combining `-S`, `-y`, and `-u` will refresh the database and upgrade all packages.

#### 4. Removing Packages

To remove a package:

```sh
sudo pacman -R package_name
```

- `-R`: Remove a package.
- `package_name`: The name of the package you want to remove.

To remove a package along with its dependencies that are no longer needed:

```sh
sudo pacman -Rs package_name
```

- `-s`: Remove the package and its dependencies that are not required by any other installed package.

#### 5. Searching for Packages

To search for a package in the repositories:

```sh
pacman -Ss keyword
```

- `-S`: Synchronize packages (search in the repositories).
- `-s`: Search for a package.
- `keyword`: The term to search for.

To search for an installed package:

```sh
pacman -Qs keyword
```

- `-Q`: Query the package database (search among installed packages).
- `-s`: Search for a package.
- `keyword`: The term to search for.

#### 6. Listing Installed Packages

To list all installed packages:

```sh
pacman -Q
```

- `-Q`: Query the package database (list installed packages).

To list all explicitly installed packages:

```sh
pacman -Qe
```

- `-e`: List explicitly installed packages (not as dependencies).

#### 7. Cleaning the Package Cache

To remove old package versions and clear the cache:

```sh
sudo pacman -Sc
```

- `-S`: Synchronize packages (clean cache).
- `-c`: Remove all cached packages that are not currently installed.

To remove all cached packages:

```sh
sudo pacman -Scc
```

- `-S`: Synchronize packages (clean cache).
- `-c`: Remove all cached packages, including those that are currently installed.

#### 8. Viewing Package Information

To view detailed information about a package:

```sh
pacman -Si package_name
```

- `-S`: Synchronize packages (view package info).
- `-i`: Show information about a package.

To view information about an installed package:

```sh
pacman -Qi package_name
```

- `-Q`: Query the package database (view installed package info).
- `-i`: Show information about an installed package.

### Advanced Pacman Commands

#### 1. Handling Dependencies

To list all packages that depend on a given package:

```sh
pacman -Qi package_name | grep "Required By"
```

- `-Q`: Query the package database.
- `-i`: Show information about an installed package.
- `grep "Required By"`: Filter the output to show only the "Required By" line.

To list all optional dependencies for a package:

```sh
pacman -Si package_name | grep "Optional Deps"
```

- `-S`: Synchronize packages.
- `-i`: Show information about a package.
- `grep "Optional Deps"`: Filter the output to show only the "Optional Deps" line.

#### 2. Installing Packages from a Local File

To install a package from a local file (e.g., a downloaded `.pkg.tar.zst` file):

```sh
sudo pacman -U /path/to/package.pkg.tar.zst
```

- `-U`: Upgrade a package from a local file.
- `/path/to/package.pkg.tar.zst`: The path to the package file.

#### 3. Forcing Package Installation

To force the installation of a package, ignoring dependency checks and file conflicts (use with caution):

```sh
sudo pacman -Syf package_name
```

- `-S`: Synchronize packages.
- `-y`: Refresh the package database.
- `-f`: Force the installation of the package.

### Pacman Configuration

Pacman's configuration file is located at `/etc/pacman.conf`. Key sections include:

#### 1. Repositories

Repositories are defined in the `[repositories]` section. You can add, remove, or prioritize repositories here.

Example:

```ini
[core]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

[extra]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

[community]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

#### 2. Miscellaneous Options

You can set various options in the `[options]` section, such as:

- `HoldPkg`: Packages that should not be removed.
- `CleanMethod`: How to clean the package cache.

Example:

```ini
[options]
HoldPkg = pacman glibc
CleanMethod = KeepCurrent
```

## Yay: AUR Helper for Arch Linux

Example:

```json
{
  "makepkg": {
    "path": "/usr/bin/makepkg",

man` and `yay` together:
