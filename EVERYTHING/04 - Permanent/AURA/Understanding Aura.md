Others may perceive auras indirectly through sensations, emotions, or intuitive insights. Interpretation of aura colors and patterns varies widely across cultures and belief systems, with each color often associated with specific qualities or attributes.

Western esoteric traditions often emphasize the symbolic and metaphysical aspects of the aura, linking it to concepts like consciousness and the soul.
