**1. Definition of Heuristics:**
   - Heuristics are cognitive shortcuts or mental strategies that people employ to simplify decision-making and problem-solving processes.
   - These shortcuts often involve relying on readily available information, past experiences, or simple rules to make judgments quickly, without engaging in exhaustive deliberation or analysis.

**2. Types of Heuristics:**
   - **Representativeness Heuristic:** This heuristic involves judging the likelihood of an event based on how similar it is to a typical example or prototype. For example, if someone fits the stereotype of a librarian (e.g., wears glasses, is introverted), people may incorrectly assume that they are more likely to be a librarian than, say, a truck driver.
   - **Availability Heuristic:** This heuristic involves estimating the likelihood of an event based on how easily instances or examples of it come to mind. For instance, people may overestimate the likelihood of rare but vivid events (e.g., plane crashes) because they receive extensive media coverage and are easily recalled from memory.
   - **Anchoring and Adjustment Heuristic:** This heuristic involves starting with an initial anchor or reference point and adjusting one's estimate based on additional information. However, individuals often fail to adjust sufficiently from the initial anchor, leading to biased judgments. For example, if asked to estimate the population of a city after being given a high or low anchor, individuals' estimates tend to be influenced by the initial anchor.

**3. Cognitive Biases Associated with Heuristics:**
   - Heuristics can lead to cognitive biases, which are systematic errors in judgment or decision-making that deviate from rationality.
   - Common cognitive biases associated with heuristics include:
     - **Confirmation Bias:** Tendency to search for, interpret, or remember information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.
     - **Overconfidence Bias:** Tendency to overestimate one's own abilities, knowledge, or judgments, leading to unwarranted confidence in one's decisions.
     - **Base Rate Neglect:** Tendency to ignore or underweight base rate information (e.g., prior probabilities) when making judgments, focusing instead on specific case information.
     - **Availability Bias:** Tendency to overestimate the importance or likelihood of events based on how easily examples or instances come to mind.

**4. Impact on Decision-Making:**
   - Heuristics and associated biases can influence decision-making in various domains, including finance, medicine, and everyday life.
   - While heuristics can be efficient and adaptive in many situations, they can also lead to errors and suboptimal decisions when applied inappropriately or under certain conditions.
   - Recognizing the presence of heuristics and biases can help individuals make more informed and rational decisions by actively considering alternative perspectives, seeking additional information, and engaging in reflective thinking.
