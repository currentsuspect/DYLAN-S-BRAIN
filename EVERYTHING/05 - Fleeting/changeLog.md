## CHANGELOG 20240403 5:15

Wednesday [[2024-04-03]] 

(Passive Incomes, Universal Basic Incomes, Growth Mindset, Solipsism)

### Passive Incomes
- Instagram theme page
- TikTok theme page
- YouTube Automation

### universal Basic Incomes
I learnt that universal basic incomes are one way to cope with poverty and help balance the rich-to-poor ratio. Although not fully understood due to lack of proper research and how expensive this project is its a very beneficial idea and should be reviewed.

### Growth mindset
<<<<<<< HEAD
I believe that everyone should adopt a growth mindset. the mindset that you can never fully know about everything and that one should be open minded and fully aware that life everyone started out knowing nothing and its the growth mindset that allowed us to reach where we are now...so adopt it [[quiet your ego]] and live your life just like you did as a kid...full of curiosity and hungry for knowledge and truly...we can succeed in life

>>>>>>> origin/main

### Solipsism
I am a strong believer of **Solipsism**: The belief that there is nothing else in existence other than the mind. 
This is because I did this experiment : I started thinking - how can I prove that this laptop is real. there is no way to prove it with out using my body...
Then I started to ask how can I prove that my body exists (it can just all be an illusion and all this is just part of it)

The only thing I could prove was real in life was the thing that is thinking this Thoughts cause that's me. I know for a fact that my thoughts are thoughts, therefore my mind exists. 
And there is no other way to prove that anything else exists

### BLUFFS

Thursday [[2024-04-04]]
- I'm currently watching suits. I watched not fully it but I'm trying to watch it again while learning law to catch on some details I missed and the first thing that catches my attention is the way [[Gabriel Macht]] bluffs that he had received payment to work on the case and yet he wasn't paid. The way he bluffed is he showed this paper that he lied was a cheque from the clients firm but that was no cheque.
- What fascinated me was how he lied he even fooled us the audience that that was a check. 
- Bluffing is an artform of some sorts that requires high skills

I went ahead and taught my self to bluff

1. **Maintain Confidence:** Confidence is key when bluffing. Projecting assurance in your actions, speech, and demeanor can make your bluff more convincing. Avoid hesitating or showing signs of nervousness, as these can give away your deception.

2. **Control Your Body Language:** Pay close attention to your body language, as it can betray your true intentions. Maintain relaxed posture, avoid fidgeting, and make deliberate, controlled movements. Keep your facial expressions neutral to prevent giving away any hints about your hand.

3. **Observe Your Opponents:** Pay attention to the behavior and tendencies of your opponents. Look for patterns in their actions, such as betting behavior, expressions, or body language cues that may indicate the strength or weakness of their hands. Use this information to tailor your bluffing strategy accordingly.

4. **Choose Your Moments:** Timing is crucial when bluffing. Wait for opportune moments to execute your bluff, such as when your opponents are likely to be more susceptible to deception or when the stakes are high. Avoid bluffing too frequently, as it can become predictable and less effective.

5. **Create a Narrative:** Build a believable story or narrative to support your bluff. Incorporate details and actions that are consistent with the image you're trying to portray. The more cohesive and convincing your bluff, the more likely it is to succeed.

6. **Stay Calm Under Pressure:** Be prepared for challenges and potential pushback from your opponents. If confronted or questioned about your bluff, remain composed and maintain your confidence. Avoid becoming defensive or providing unnecessary explanations that could weaken your position.

7. **Mix Up Your Strategy:** Keep your opponents guessing by varying your bluffing techniques. Incorporate different tactics, such as semi-bluffing (bluffing with a hand that has potential to improve) or reverse psychology, to keep them off-balance and unsure of your intentions.

8. **Know When to Fold:** Bluffing is a calculated risk, and sometimes, it's best to fold rather than continue bluffing in the face of strong opposition. Recognize when your bluff has been called or when the circumstances no longer favor deception, and gracefully concede if necessary.




## Aura

An aura is an energy field that surrounds living beings, including humans, animals, and plants. While auras are not visible to the naked eye for most people, some individuals claim to have the ability to perceive them through extrasensory perception or psychic sensitivity.

1. **Unconscious Incompetence**: These are the folks who don't know that they don't know. In psychological terms, they are in a state of "unconscious incompetence." They lack awareness of their own ignorance in a particular subject or skill. They may confidently assert their knowledge or abilities despite being uninformed or unskilled.
    
2. **Conscious Incompetence**: This group acknowledges that they don't know, but they mistakenly believe they do. They're in a state of "conscious incompetence." These individuals may recognize their lack of knowledge or skill in a certain area, yet they overestimate their proficiency. This can lead to overconfidence and potentially misguided actions.
    
3. **Conscious Competence**: These are the individuals who are aware of what they don't know, and they're comfortable with it. They're in a state of "conscious competence." Instead of pretending to know everything, they embrace their gaps in knowledge and actively seek to learn and improve. They understand that learning is a lifelong journey and are open to new information and experiences.
