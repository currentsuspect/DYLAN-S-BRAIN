# DAILY NOTE
### *Wednesday, April 3th, 2024*

## Journal
***1.Philosophy
-So today I studied philosophy and realized that I am not crazy and that life is far more intricate and fascinating than I thought. so I realized that reality is very subjective and that it heavily depends on you and what you perceive of it.
-I only have one question: why isn't it all direct and why cant we just conclude that your red is my red and call it a day. I know that is not logic but still it should be easy.
-I am more of a the only one in the world type of thinker.(solipsist) I think that all what I see and think is just from me and my conscience. But the few things that makes me question this thinking is because I know myself (or do I?) I cant start wars I cant make these cool technologies
(if I took time to study I guess...) I can't be evil as people out here. But its fine still. I may not have all the answers but I will try to...that's all that matters.***

***2.MUSIC
l most connected with the world through music. I listen to music for hours on end I get goosebumps when I listen to certain music(I think there is a word for this...let me google this...)(`frisson`). I'm currently trying to produce music by becoming a producer.(I'm 3 Years In) its going well but I am in a state where I feel like I want to make music. By that I mean become the producer and the artist (everything basically) but it isn't as easy because I have to multitask, learn music and also learn production.
-mostly in production and in life in general I learnt that...
``It isn't a must you know everything to make something ~Me ``
-so I'm trying not to know everything and only the things I want to use and the rest will come
-I'm also trying to make the best playlist I can possibly make (hip-hop playlist) mostly underground songs.***

***-Here is the playlist if you are wondering my taste in music [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/59Ug0DwqVP3ijkS3ARop9Y?si=7c4ea04715e2466f]()***
