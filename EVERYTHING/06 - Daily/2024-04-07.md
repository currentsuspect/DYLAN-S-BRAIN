# DAILY NOTE
### *Sunday, April 7th, 2024*

## Journal
Today I have gained clarity on a lot of questions I had in life. I used to second guess everything I do, seek validation and do everything in my power to be right, get people to understand my view on life and it keeps happening from time to time but I gain more clarity in life on why not to do those. I also I'm fond of people pleasing and trying to make people happy instead of satisfying my needs. but I'm now understanding things more clearly and its not as easy as everything else in life. because perusing your needs first can lead selfish ambitions but, also attending to other peoples needs can also lead to people pleasing and not attaining your personal goals I need to find a way to maintain balance to all. And one is by surrounding myself with people who know that this, and don't want to use you to their advantage only which will be a bad thing. second is to know your worth and when to say no. at times it can be hard to say no and it's ok - it takes time, but by recognizing this one can maintain the balance perfectly and have themselves not affected by the issue of people pleasing and selfishness.
