# DAILY NOTE
### *Tuesday, April 9th, 2024*

## Journal
So I realized that I have to lock in and do this full hearted instead of slacking and half-offing it all so that's what I'm gonna do. Lock all the way in get all this information first, be selfish a bit and see where it all goes so I know what to do I know that I won't be perfect. I know I will have flaws but staying true to myself and locking in all the way. tunneling on my journey and for now not caring about all the other issues if they don't concern me directly. I believe that I can maintain a balance of it all study and enjoy life at the same time because work and play are intertwined and all this is just life...myyy life and I need to live it. Instead of letting life be I need to actively live and do something about it all. Since I started all this I never got a problem with life and honestly its fun to live like this, I permanently want it to be like this, me choosing what to do with my life and genuinely doing things I want daily, for the rest of my life.
