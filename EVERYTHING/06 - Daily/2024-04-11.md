# DAILY NOTE
### *Thursday, April 11th, 2024*

## Journal
I'm having a problem and I didn't see it as a problem until I tried stopping. I have never told anyone of this. except my ex back in 2019. I have a masturbation addiction and I am trying to stop. But it's hard because my urges usually take control and I find myself going back to my roots. but I am definitely working on it. And I will reduce it to probably once every three days and see how hard that will be to see if its a hard to quit addiction or just minor. Other than that I've started becoming lazy but I'm noticing it. And that's a step, I will get back fully on Saturday. I realized that learning all this things takes a toll on ones energy and I've definitely experienced burnout today than ever before I even started seeing all this as pointless. And its fascinating how the brain tricks you into not doing a task once burnout takes effect and I won't give in.
