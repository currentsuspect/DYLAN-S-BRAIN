# DAILY NOTE
### *Tuesday, April 2nd, 2024*

## Journal
Learning philosophy has helped me get out of my bubble of confidence and what I think of as my reality. I am understanding why things are the way they are and that its fine to be where I am a point of no understanding of what I am and what to do in this vast world I am In. I hope I gain more and more clarity in the coming days and better understand what to do.
