# DAILY NOTE
### *Monday, April 8th, 2024*

## Journal

So Yesternight I had the craziest of experiences...so I was meditating and just focusing on my breath and I don't know how long in I was in for but I felt an adrenaline rush from my legs going up to my head. so at first it was a bit scary but few seconds in I started feeling good and I mean seriously good. last time I felt this way was when I got high off of weed. but this one was all that without the paranoia. then it got more intense and more intense and I was just feeling amazing I even got an erection from that feeling alone. then I should point out that I started feeling a pinch on my heart like I could feel the neurotransmitters firing from my brain to the heart. then my door opened and everything stopped.
