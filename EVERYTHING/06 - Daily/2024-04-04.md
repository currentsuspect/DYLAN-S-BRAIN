# DAILY NOTE
### *Thursday, April 4th, 2024*

## Journal

So today I realized that it is all connected. Everything from decisions to choices to beliefs to why people strife to make money to survive. I realized that it should be like this, that's the beauty of all of this and if it was not like this things would be out of balance. The more I study the more knowledgeable and woke I truly become. Like today I actually understood money and why it is so valuable. money is just a transaction, an exchange of value. Say I need fish and I have money, I find someone with fish to sell it to me. Thus he provided value to me(fish) and money is nothing else far from this. This realization made me conclude that if you need money...provide value and the more the value the more the money. It also made me realize that money isn't success truly(I'm not yet rich but I fully understand this)

Main reason people want money so much is just because they want freedom from this world...to do whatever they want.
So I'm not delusional to say that money only solves money problems and nothing else it isn't the cure to mental issues, health risks and other various factors.

I also realized that life is a journey of self that every person has...its Wonderful truly that everyone in the world has their own worldview and how various factors affect this worldview.

I feel like more people don't even know how Wonderful life is because they aren't living their lives to their full potential. And its sad but I guess it has to be like that and it's fine. I used to try and make my friends come to my realizations and sometimes they wouldn't get me and it was so frustrating to have to see them not living to their fullest potential. But I stopped trying to explain because I realized that everyone is on their own journey and trying to speed up their journey is not beneficial to them and that I should instead focus on my own goals experience my own life...know more on what I don't cause in the end nothing in life matters and whatever I do now may not even be a thing A Billon years from now.

Figuring things out is hard but I still have to try cause I want to genuinely know this things understand myself, the world around me and also live to my fullest potential while I'm still here cause why not?
