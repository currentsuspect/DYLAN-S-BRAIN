# DAILY NOTE
### *Friday, April 5th, 2024*

## Journal
today I realized that we all have biases whether based on our political, Cultural, perceptional or even Observational view of things. we often project thing based of of these biases, for example I had a conversation with my dad on why he was not ok with my mom not sharing things evenly on the house, for example buying sausages and not sharing with him and this troubled my dad so much so basing this of of bias my dad believes that mainly just because my mom doesn't share this apple, that she isn't promoting good values. but my mom does share things. she buys things and shares but my dad doesn't see those instead he focuses on the negative things...in addition he feels like my mom doesn't value her daughter...my stepsister of which she doesn't share things with. so in my opinion I see it as neutral and my mom doesn't need to care for my stepsister because she isn't her child and that she should only care about us her children but still I'm conflicted too by this thinking because things should be shared evenly if one has a good heart (I guess) but this still goes to show that non of them are wrong in their own perception because of bias and choosing to favor one side...(their own) and not considering the other party is bias and should be a well thought of subject...im conflicted in what to do next but i will figure it out.
