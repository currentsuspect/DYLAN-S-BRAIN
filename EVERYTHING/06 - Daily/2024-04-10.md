# DAILY NOTE
### *Wednesday, April 10th, 2024*

## Journal
Today I'm trying to get back to my old ways (old good ways)where I was disciplined and was setting goals and achieving them. I have come to the realization that self-discipline is one powerful aspect of life and that for me to even start knowing how to get to where I want I need some level of self-discipline. For this I have designed a plan to do things my way and that if I continue with my path of trying truly my best to achieve what I want, I truly believe that I 100% will and there is no doubt what so ever. I'm wishing that I don't get lost in this whirlpool of doubt that something I'm doing now I'll regret. I know that I won't regret because it's me and that I will regret that I didn't stick to it. So let me continue and see where it goes.
